This repository is for the competitions on Kaggle. I am going to develop unique and extensive Time series models
classification and clustering tools to make life easy and accessible for many
time series data. For example, a person can download a dataset from the Yahoo finance, lets say IBM's stock price in 5 years span then, from my repo
using the notebook to create better and creater  result.
